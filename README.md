# glacier-mass-balance-over-time
This project analyzes historical glacier mass balance data to understand the impact of climate change. Findings show a decline in mass balance, with Decision Tree and Random Forest models most accurate in predicting future trends. This emphasizes the urgency for addressing climate change to protect glaciers and vital water resources.
